TODO:
no addition
misleading function names (ex: While( x > 1) equates to if(x>1)) - we should do more than just this

DONE:
no compiler warnings when breaking these restrictions, only Exceptions
variables have to start with t
max length = 5 for variable names
no vowels in strings (including literals) or variable names
if a variable is not defined when called upon, assign it a random value

NOTES:
when we initialize a var to random value, we still throw excpetions if that ran value is even
